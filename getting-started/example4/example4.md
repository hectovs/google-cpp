## Task 3 
### Game Requirements 
Time for us to start writing computer games! This first one will be a bit simple, but it's a start. Our task is to write a program that implements a guessing game. Our program generates a random number between 0 and 100. The player must guess the secret number. The program provides hints like "that's too high" or "that's too low" until the player finally guesses the secret number.

We will work on this game in three steps. 

Figure out how to generate a random number within a given range of values.
Create a main function that processes one guess from the player, and provides hints.
Add what we need to allow for multiple guesses until the player guesses the number.
This process of development is called decomposition, which means breaking a task into sub-tasks, each of which is easy to do.

generate and store a random number 
store which numbers have already been guessed

## Task 2 

The greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest number that divides them both evenly. For example, gcd(12, 18) = 6, gcd(âˆ’4, 14) = 2. The most efficient way to compute gcd is with the Euclidean algorithm. Write a program with a function to compute gcd for two integers. Try doing the function without recursion first - it will help you understand how the algorithm works.
Explicitly define your sub-tasks, for example, find the code for the Euclidean algorithm; create a non-recursive function for the algorithm; etc. Here is our solution.
