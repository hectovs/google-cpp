Example 5: Math Puzzles
One of the powers of computing is being able to do a brute-force search for a solution to a problem. Trial and error works just fine for some problems. In fact, computers can be especially good at such problems. Consider this:

Horses cost $10, pigs cost $3, and rabbits are only $0.50. A farmer buys 100 animals for $100, How many of each animal did he buy? 

There is a remarkably simple solution to this problem. See if you can find it before you look at ours.

Here is another one to try:
How many ways can you arrange 6 different books, left to right, on a shelf? 

This time we will just give you the solution and let you write the program: 720.
